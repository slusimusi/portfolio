# Lingua hover

Translate an unknown word just hovering on it! No clicks, no other information, just one translation.

Lingua Hover is an extension designed for easy translation on hover.
You can set a target language from the Google-based language list.
Also, you can add a keyboard shortcut to see a translation by holding down the key.

## Plans

- to add a custom vocabulary in which you can add your unknown words
- to add more settings for custom translation output
- to make a translation more detailed with other meanings
- to add a function of translating a whole sentence
